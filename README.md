# Stock Market Analysis using Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook providing an in-depth analysis of stock market data using Python. It utilizes Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and other libraries to explore and visualize stock data.

## Overview

The notebook starts by collecting historical stock data for major Indian stock market indices and stocks, such as NIFTY, SENSEX, and select sector-specific indices, obtained using `pandas_datareader` and `yfinance`. The data spans from December 26, 2019, to December 26, 2023, capturing crucial market movements and fluctuations.

## Initial Data Exploration

The notebook conducts initial data exploration, presenting descriptive statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartiles for the various indices and stocks. Additionally, it includes visualizations plotting the prices of different assets from 2020 to showcase their performance.

## Investment Analysis

Delving deeper into assessing potential returns on investments in these assets, the analysis calculates returns on a hypothetical initial investment of 100,000 Rs in each asset. It demonstrates how these investments would have grown over the given period, illustrating both total returns and annualized returns for insights into their performance relative to each other.

## Comparison with Bonds

Expanding the analysis beyond stocks, the notebook compares stock market indices with bond assets by integrating data from the UTI Medium to Long Duration Fund Direct Growth ETF. This addition facilitates a comparison of stock market indices' volatility and performance over time against bond assets.

## Conclusion

Through visualizations and calculated returns, the notebook concludes with valuable insights into asset performances. It emphasizes potential volatility differences, compares stock market indices with bond assets, and highlights the importance of diversification in investment portfolios.
